## General Rules
1. Always ask the user before making potentially breaking changes.
2. To quickly retrieve context for user requests, refer to the project [docs](../../docs/).
   - High-level overview of project structure: [PROJECT_MAP.md](../../docs/PROJECT_MAP.md)
   - General summary of this project and the developer's goals: [01-PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../../docs/01-PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)
   - Rationale for architectural decisions: [02-ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md](../../docs/02-ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md)
   - Future Development ideas: [03-DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](../../docs/03-DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)
   - Testing: [TESTING.md](../../docs/TESTING.md)
   - A more comprehensive map of project files and their purpose can be found in [PROJECT_MAP.md](../../docs/PROJECT_MAP.md)
3. Current documentation is a priority. When making changes that may impact end-user workflows, be sure to update any relevant documentation, including the [README.md](../../README.md), [PROJECT_MAP.md](../../docs/PROJECT_MAP.md), and [SETUP.md](../../docs/SETUP.md) if appropriate.
4. Always reference the most current documentation possible for packages, depending on the version we are using. **Use the Context7 MCP server** proactively if available.

## Development Principles
When writing code, follow these principles:

### Modularity First
Design every feature with **modularity** in mind to facilitate easy expansion as the project grows, with minimal refactoring necessary. This means:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module/component does one thing well
- **Clear Interfaces**: Use Pydantic models (backend) and TypeScript types (frontend) as contracts
- **Separation of Concerns**: Routes handle HTTP, services handle business logic, connectors handle data access
- **Minimal Coupling**: Components communicate via props/callbacks, not global state
- **Easy Extension Points**: New node types, relationship types, and features should require isolated changes

See [02-Architecture Decisions: Development Principles](../../docs/02-ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#Development-Principles) for more detailed guidelines and examples.

### Human-in-the-loop
The user wants to collaborate with you for design/architecture decisions throughout this project. For decisions that may have a large impact throughout development or may require large refactors to change later, **ask the user for input**.

### Quality Standards
- Write tests for new features (pytest for backend, vitest for frontend)
- Use type hints in Python and TypeScript throughout
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document non-obvious decisions in code comments
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Keep Documentation Current
Whenever functionality is added/removed/changed, update the following files where necessary:

1. [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md)
2. [docs/01-PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../../docs/01-PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)
3. [docs/03-DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](../../docs/03-DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)
4. [docs/SETUP.md](../../docs/SETUP.md)
5. [docs/TESTING.md](../../docs/TESTING.md)
6. [docs/PROJECT_MAP.md](../../docs/PROJECT_MAP.md)
