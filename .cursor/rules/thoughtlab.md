## General Rules

1. Always ask the user before making potentially breaking changes.
2. To quickly retrieve context for user requests, refer to the project [docs](../../docs/).
   - High-level overview of project structure: [PROJECT_MAP.md](../../docs/PROJECT_MAP.md)
   - General summary of this project and the developer's goals: [01-PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../../docs/01-PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)
   - Rationale for architectural decisions: [02-ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md](../../docs/02-ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md)
   - Future Development ideas: [03-DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](../../docs/03-DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)
   - Testing: [TESTING.md](../../docs/TESTING.md)
3. Current documentation is a priority. When making changes that may impact end-user workflows, be sure to update any relevant documentation, including the [README.md](../../README.md), [PROJECT_MAP.md](../../docs/PROJECT_MAP.md), and [SETUP.md](../../docs/SETUP.md) if appropriate.
